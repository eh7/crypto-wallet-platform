# Modular Crypto Wallet Platform

The modular crypto wallet platform will allow management of crypto assets, secure private payments, peer to peer communicartion network, and the delivery of web services content within the wallet patform. Functionality could be extended with the modular system, opertaing on top of the wallet platform core functionality. 

A big part of the basic functionality is the wallet package management system. This would allow developers to create and integrate services from the other core wallet system functionality, these will include key management, P2P wallet network, Crypto assest investments, Smart Contract abi Interface, and Web Services. The modules would allow the creation user friendly interfaces for access to publicly avaiable smart contracts on any evm compatiable blockchaini, or other key functions within the wallet platform.

By using this approach the wallet functionality could be extended in the future either by developers or by the community of developers that will be built up around the wallet platform.

The basic wallet functionality is outlined below, the final specification will be further definded during the specification stage that we will be undertake as a first phase of the development cycle. This will allow us to focus on the the feature that we all feal is best suited to create a wallet platform that will be the most usful and attractive to protential users and developers moving forward. 

## Basic Wallet functionality;

  ### Key management, security and settings
   * create
   * import
   * manage
   * security (recover, backup, share, security tools) 

  ### Wallet application package management
   * create a new package (admin function)
   * manage a package (admin function)
   * install
   * remove
   * manage

  ### Crypto asset management
   * transfer
   * manage
   * bridge to
   * bridge from
   * logs

  ### P2P wallet network
   * payment
   * names
   * web service
   * comms (message, share, video)
   * config

  ### Crypto assest investment
    * stake
    * mine
    * funds 
    * manage

  ### Smart Contract abi Interface
   * import smart contracts
   * manage smart contracts
   * smart contracts usage logs

  ### Web Service
   * consum service
   * publish service
   * serverless application deployment
   * serverless api
   * serverless application scripting lib



## Conclusions

Access to crypto payments and assest is growing accross the world and is project to grow further over the comming years. I believe this type of platform has the potential to resolve many of the technical bariers that are currently in place and this could be a good asset in achiving this progress through adoption.
It would allow access to usefull blockchain technogies and services through a secure interface, from secure private payment, published smart contract(s) functionality, p2p communication to usable serveless web services.
I believe that by focusing in a large part on modular system and the web service elements, it will allow the delivery and extension of the platform, with the potential path for growth in the future.
I also believe with further development there could be a potential for users to supply services to platform, with spare comput and network resources they may have access to, which could earn them rewards. 


# Further Notes;

Function in this proposal have been based on some on my previouse development work and investigations over the last 3 years or more years. The proposal is also based on the esitamated time required for me to undertake the project which is 6 to 12 months period. However if the proposal is acceptd and further features or functions specified, there would be the potential for me to engaue other devemnet assests that I work with on previouse projects, both in web3 and web2 projects, to spead up or extend the functionality as it may be seen fit.


Current Development Status;
 * electron app - single code base for web based interface and mobile device app interface
 * abi smart contract interface basic impementation
 * libp2p wallet network basic implementaiona proof of setup, create, and comms
 * Development Options: cdk (poylgon), evm, level2 optionsplease think about it??
 * Development option: private assest payment network (see tornado cash) level 2 solution (deployment options???)
 * asset bridge may be resolable by using something that is already avaiable, furth research required around how this is undertaken (more thoughts???)
