Modular Crypto Wallet Platform

The Modular Wallet Platform will be an ecosystem of interfaces, services, nodes, and protocols, to allow the delivery of a decentralised modular wallet platform.

The phased development approach will allow the development of the wallet platform functionality to optomise the development resources, and marketing potential as the development phases progress.

The phase 1 cycle will target secure private payments for the internation remitance sector of users. This was chosen as it is a growing and proven use case for international money transfers.

The phase 2 cycle will then target develoment of the core wallet platform servcies and how they interact to create the full core services and function of the platform.

Phase 3 will focus on the development of the decentralised elements and associated token, reward stucutures, protocols and interfaces to deliver these functions. 

The main features of the wallet platform will be, private key managment, storage and recovery, secure private payments, a package based application repository, smart contract ABI interface, peer to peer network for communication within the wallet platform, and a decentralised web service functionality to allow the delivery and sharing of data in a trully decentralised manner. These features will combine to create a platform that will be easy to use for non technical users, private, secure, and have the ability to rewards developers and service providers with a rewards stream for the use of their services or work.

The wallet platform will allow crypto currency holders to make secure private transfers, manage their private keys, and access the wallet applications that will be contibuted to it's app store by it's developer user base. These contributed applications will provide functionality that will allow the wallet users to interact with already published smart contracts on a variarty of evm based blockchains, access crypto staking, mining, and investment applications, use the built in peer to peer network for communcation, interaction, payments and commerce with others users or organisations that are using or have publish applications on the wallet platfrom.  

The wallet platfrom will be targeted at everyday users providing a simple and usable experience within the web3 space. Where users need little to no understanding of the underlying function or the technology. The idea being that access to [ackage functionality will be simple and accessable, provide access to secure private payments, and will help drive the adoption of crypto currecy use in a private and commercial way, as it will provide these servcies in a simular maner to web3 commerce and content based system and platforms. 

The other main feature of the wallet platfrom is the decentrailsed nature of the system, and how it will allow conributer users to earn rewards for their contribution to running and providing functionality on the platform. These rewards should have the affect of building a community that has a economic interest in the use and expansion of the platform, it's servcies, applications and function.

Much like the http protocol, databases, and scripting languages enabled the delivery on commercial and content services accross the web2 world over 20 years ago. I evisage a platform where commercial entaprises could create functionality to sell, communicate, and interact with teir client base in a simple and use friendly way. I believ this approch will allow the stream adoption of crypto currencies as a means of commerce, and communication. 


Delevelopment Plan

To deliver the platform we think a 3 phase approach is most appropriate. This allows the key function or the platform to be implemented in a way that focus first om the foundation of the platform, secure private payments. Then the wallet platfrom core servcies and their interactions and interfaces, and finally the decentralised reward elements and protocols to build commitent and a dedicated technical user base that will have a long term benifit in contributing the success of the platform moving forward.
