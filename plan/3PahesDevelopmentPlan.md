Modular Crypto Wallet Platform

The Modular Wallet Platform will consist of an ecosystem of interfaces, services, nodes, and protocols, to allow the delivery of a decentralised modular wallet platform.

The initial target user case will be the internation remitance payment market, this has been chosen as it is a proven and growing market that the wallet platform will be aimed and marketed to. Attracting user of this target market the first phase of development will focus on the implementation and development of the secure private transfers, on the etherum and polygon main networks. The work will form the foundation on to which all the other servcies offered through the wallet platform will sit around. This first phase of development will aim to be deliverd within 3 months of the project start date and will make up the initial release.

The second and third development phases will aim to expand the user case user base that the wallet platform will target at.

Firstly in phase 2 to the general use crypto user base will be targeted by providing further key management services, communication and collabaration tools and function through the peer to peer networking and content sharing services. We will also imlement and introduce crypto assest management and investment services and functionality. All the services will be avaiable and usable through the wallet platform package system. The package system will also developers to contribute scritpble and configarable application functionality, that others users on the walllet platform will be able to use and interacte with. 

For the final phase of development, the focuse will be on extending the use case to developers and service providers, in order to make the platform a trully decentralised platfrom and operating environment. Wallet users will be able to access and interact with the applications created, and the developers will rewarded economicly or by some other means depending on what the developers motivations where in creating the applications and publishing them to the wallet platform application store. The service providers will also be able to earn rewards for providing remote compute and data services to the wallet platform, so as to enable the decentrailsed delivery of the wallet platform services and the applications that are published on the platform.  

Timescales for the phase 1 are 3 months, phase 2 are 6 months and phase 3 are 6 months. However if after phase 1 development has been realeased and there is the motivation and funding to speed up the delivery times, the development team could be scaled up so as to speed up the delivery of phase 2 or 3 functions and services and to meet any demand that may have been created.

The main features of the wallet platform will be, private key managment, storage and recovery, secure private payments, a package based application repository, smart contract ABI interface, peer to peer network for communication within the wallet platform, and a decentralised web service functionality to allow the delivery and sharing of data in a trully decentralised manner. These features will combine to create a platform that will be easy to use for non technical users, private, secure, and have the ability to rewards developers and service providers with a rewards stream for the use of their services or work.

The wallet platform will allow crypto currency holders to make secure private transfers, manage their private keys, and access the wallet applications that will be contibuted to it's app store by it's developer user base. These contributed applications will provide functionality that will allow the wallet users to interact with already published smart contracts on a variarty of evm based blockchains, access crypto staking, mining, and investment applications, use the built in peer to peer network for communcation, interaction, payments and commerce with others users or organisations that are using or have publish applications on the wallet platfrom.  

The wallet platfrom will be targeted at everyday users providing a simple and usable experience within the web3 space. Where users need little to no understanding of the underlying function or the technology. The idea being that access to [ackage functionality will be simple and accessable, provide access to secure private payments, and will help drive the adoption of crypto currecy use in a private and commercial way, as it will provide these servcies in a simular maner to web3 commerce and content based system and platforms. 

The other main feature of the wallet platfrom is the decentrailsed nature of the system, and how it will allow conributer users to earn rewards for their contribution to running and providing functionality on the platform. These rewards should have the affect of building a community that has a economic interest in the use and expansion of the platform, it's servcies, applications and function.

Much like the http protocol, databases, and scripting languages enabled the delivery on commercial and content services accross the web2 world over 20 years ago. I evisage a platform where commercial entaprises could create functionality to sell, communicate, and interact with teir client base in a simple and use friendly way. I believ this approch will allow the stream adoption of crypto currencies as a means of commerce, and communication. 


Development Phases functionality and justification

The phased development approach will allow the development of the wallet platform functionality to optomise the development resources, and marketing potential as the development phases progress.

The phase 1 cycle will target secure private payments for the internation remitance sector of users. This was chosen as it is a growing and proven use case for international money transfers.

The phase 2 cycle will then target develoment of the core wallet platform servcies and how they interact to create the full core services and function of the platform.

Phase 3 will focus on the development of the decentralised elements and associated token, reward stucutures, protocols and interfaces to deliver these functions. 


Delevelopment Plan

To deliver the platform we think a 3 phase approach is most appropriate. This allows the key function or the platform to be implemented in a way that focus first om the foundation of the platform, secure private payments. Then the wallet platfrom core servcies and their interactions and interfaces, and finally the decentralised reward elements and protocols to build commitent and a dedicated technical user base that will have a long term benifit in contributing the success of the platform moving forward.
