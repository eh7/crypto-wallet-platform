Define the proposed initial development phase 6 to 12 months, targeting a core platform that is targeted to international remitance payments.
***

This initial phase of development plan is the development work required to deliver a core wallet platform as outlined in the Core Function Section.

The core services required to power the basic Wallet Platform will be created with scaffold sevice functionality. These services will be extended in further development phases moving forward.

The key users are the end user, developers and service providers. The interface requirements are for the wallet interface, developer interface, service provider interface and package management interface. Each user type will interact with the their interface to access the service functionality appropriate to configuration and usage of their function. The only exception to this is the package management interface which will be accessed by all user types and used to publish, configure and use the mpachage function within the wallet platform. In the initial devlopment phase the developer interface and the service provider interface will be very minamal as they will only be used by the development team to setup and configure the initial phase 1 functionalty. As this is extended in phase 2 functionality these interfaces will be fleshed out and become more functional to to over system services and package delivery.   

The inital phase will have all services (package management, data, p2p net, and abi) required to deliver the Wallet Platform, but they will use network infrastructure that is managed and controlled by the Wallet Platform Development Team. By taking this appoach we remove the need to focus on incentive structures at this point to allow the true decntralisation of the platform. I think these incentive structures are going to drive future adoption by different user sets providing and gain rewords through their contribution to the platform.

This phase will be completed within the estimated time of 6 to 12 months. To achieve these goals in this timescale there will be a need for one engineer and some input and time from a consultant interface designer to create the basic look, feel, and associated styles for the Wallet Platform.

The target audiance of this first phase is the already established and growing international remitance payments sector. I believe that by targeting this use case at this point it will allows to focus our time on a lucrative use case, and will form the founation for future functional service development with the Wallet Platform more generally. Appling the leason we earn from implementing internation payments will allow more efficent development of other Wallet Platform service features.

By dividing the development phases like this I believe we can focus the development work better and create a better core and then final platform. Understanding a single use well that is known to be a growing market, while still having our eye on the growth of potential and new features moving forward and how they can be impmented more quickly within the platform..
