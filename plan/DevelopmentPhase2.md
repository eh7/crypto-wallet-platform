Define the next development phase to show how this would be appoached, outside the 6 to 12 months inital development plan, explaining how this could be done in tadem if the resources to do this are in place.
***

This phase will cover the extension or the p2p network service functionality by adding rewards structure for develpoers and service providers on the Wallet Platform.

The inital development phase will have access to a basic scaffold struct for all these services required to deliver functionality, but in this phase of development we will expend on these services to allow the creation a trully decentralised Wallet Platfrom, that will have incentive structures to allow the running of the platform with little to no centralised infrastructure. Once this is phase is complete I believe the platform will have the potential to be out sourced so the future development could be self managed outside the core development team but still manage and controled by them to manitain focus and direction. 

Further decusion and decisions would need to be taken at a future point as to how the incentive structures work, and how the Wallet Platform token will be used to pay for services used with the platform without cause barriers to general use. The econmic structure of the token and how this relates to the reward stuctures, processes, and underlying protocols will need futher definition.

I believe that this work will attract the developers and service providers who would become very commited to the platform as they would gain a direct benefit from the increased usage and expansion of the services the platform could offer. I believe this is the key to a decentraised platform taking hold and surviving, by having commited developers and providers gaining tokens for their service, it builds commitment and financial interest in the platform. Allowing this user base to support and help it grow into the future.
