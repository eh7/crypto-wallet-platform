Define the next development phase to show how this would be appoached, outside the 6 to 12 months inital development plan, explaining how this could be done in tadem if the resources to do this are in place.

This phase will cover the extension or the p2p network service functionality by adding rewards structure for develpoers and service providers on the Wallet Platform.

The inital development phase will have access to a basic scaffold struct for these services, but in the stage of development we will expend on these services to allow the creation a trully decentralised Wallet Platfrom, that will have incentive structures to allow the running of the platform with little to no centralised infrastructure. Once this is phase is complete I believe the platform will have the potential to be out sourced so the future development will be self managed outside the core development team. 

Further decusion and decisions would need to be taken at a future point to how the incentive structures work, and how the Wallet Platform token will be used to pay for services used with the platform without cause barriers to general use. The econmic structure of this token and how these related to the reward stuctures, processes, and underlying protocols will need futher definition.
