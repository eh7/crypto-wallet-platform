Discuse ways that would allow the development speeded up and the resurces that may be required to do this.

Should there be a requirement for a excelerated development time line for phase 1 or phase 2 targeted platform, this could be achieved by breaking down the development tasks further into the core function work flows

 This would allow individual work streams to be assigned to multipul developers simaltainously so that each can focus on their assigned workflow.

This approach would speed up delivery of the overall platform. I have attempted to show this in the project gant chart. By doing this the reader will be able to see visualy what each individual work flow would be and how it could be approached in linear maner by a single developer or in a paralle maner by a team of developers.  

Depending on what the targeted time scale are and the development budget. The phase 1 or phase 2 delivery times could be reduced or increased by taking this approach. The development team to be scaled up so as to speed the development cycle or redecued if the buget was not available at the time.

By dividing the development tasks into unquie work flows that can be approached as an individual or a team, flexbility is created in the speed of the development and the target of the development work to achieve functional goals.

This approach should also alows developers to be enaged that have a skill set that is highly suited to the development task at hand. For example I have worked with recently a graduated software developer whos focus in their final project was on zero knowledge proofs and use in private payment network. This person could be assign the develpoment of the private payments work flow and the integration of these functions into the overall Wallet Platform functionality. I think this would allow the the development team to focus on key functional services and speed up delivery and quality of the final product in a timely manner.

However to achieve the above mentioned benfits and the speeding up of the overall time line. There would need to be be a full analysis of the platform and each services function work flow being targeted and how the interactions between the different work flows would interact or interface with each other, so as to understand how the development task are best separated structured into their most simple separted approach.

The initial breakdown of the functional development work streams can be seen in the gant charts presented later in this document. These are open to amentment if there are potential changes to the focus of the development and functional features.
