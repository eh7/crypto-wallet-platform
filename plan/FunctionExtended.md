Expalin the enhaced function and development requirements need to deliver the final fully functional wallet platform, including all incentive structures to allow the delivery of the platform in a decentralised manner. Discuse how this is a long term goal and how there are more than one way to this and it all depends on the way the wallet platform will be licensed and marketed.

The phase 2 enhanced functionality will allow the wallet platform the ability to attract a new type a user. These users will engage with the platform not to use the wallet functionaiolty but to provide the services and packaged applications for use with the wallet platform. These contributions will rewarded for their efforts in the form a platform token. This will have two fold effect, one it will allow the pltform to be dillivered in a ddecentralised manaer, and also to create a user base that has an interest in the platform growing and increasing usage as they will be rewarded directly if their services or development efforts are used by any wallet user on the platform.
