# Lowering Barriers to Web3 Applications

Lowering barriers to adoption of web3 applications and their associated benfits for users and contributers is key to this proposed work. Web3 technologies have many benits over the traditional web2 applications, these include enhancing privacy, usabiltiy, and the movement away from centralised propriotory software provision that benifits the third party company or owner of the software and towardsa world or security, privacy, system transparancy, and imutability. Where a central organistion can not chage functionality that may finicaly benifit them, but possibly not the usablity and open access to the servcies. In the web2 world the biggest example of this is where online ads have become the default means of a company to monetise thier software, where as in the web3 world the users pays for the servcies used direct to the company providing, the rewards provided are pre defined and clear before any servcie is used or provided. These rewards are set as part of the protocol that the provider and user use to provide the service.  

Currently web3 applications and wallets are focused on the more technical user just now, you need a level of technical knowlege to leverage these oppertunites currently so that you understand the risk and potial benefit of the technolgy used. You do not need to be a computer scientist or engineer, but you do need to understand the key ideas and technolgies so that you interact and beifit from them now.

An example of this is that many people use meta mask which is a good usfull producti to manage your private keys and interactions with a given blockchain, but the target audiance has to understand the setup and confirguration of this before they even get into the opertunities that this tool gives them access to. Application developers have also leveaged wallet techology like meta mask, and provide interfaces that allow you interact withe their ecosystem functionality using a third party wallet. I think this has benifts and drawbacks. The benifits being that developers can create interfaces to their web3 functionality without having to worry about the key management side of the development equation. This as I see it is barrier to adoption by non technical users as users will have to invest the time and effort to understand and then leverage these technologies to use the web3 resouerces. There is not much in the way of support for the users to be helped along the way and believe this is slowing adoption.

The wallet platform aims to address these short commings by levelaging simple basic techniques to generate, secure, manage your keys, and make secure private payments. Adding to this a secure private peer to peer network with a cloud based services architecure, smart contract abi interface for importing already deployed smart contracts on any evm compable blockchain, and a modular package system that can be used to script and bring together the feature and servcies to create user interfaces in a simple and intuative way. This usage can then create conributions back into platfrom to fund the development and provision of the platform servcies and application in a structure and transparent way.   


There has been some development focusing on enabling the casual user to access and gain the benits of web3 techologies. However this should improved over the comming years as the technologies and tooling improves. Currenlty within the web application wether web based of smart phone app based you are able to do most things is a userfriendly easy manner. Wether that is payments, communication, and or access to shared compute resources. Not to mention many other use cases that are currently avaiable in the web2 world, such as ecommerce, ticketing, events, delivery, sharing and earning though investments with you saved or spare assets. These assest could be cryto currency that could be depoyed into a system that would earn a passive income, or from a spare computer and network resources that you may have available that could rean you rewards for the leasing of the usage of these resources.

The wallet platform aim will be to enable all users to access a rich eco-system web3 servcies and functionality, through a platform that helps mitigate key managemnet risks, provides tools to make mitigating risks and errors easier, and that can make the users experience within the web3 application space more simple in general.
