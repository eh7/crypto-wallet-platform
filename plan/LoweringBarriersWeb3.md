** Lowering barriers to web3 applications and their benfit for users and contributers. Make the point that web tech enhances privacy, usabiltiy (web adpoted), see notes in little red note book for positives. **

Web3 applications and wallets are focused on the more technical user just now, you need a level of technical knowlege to leverage these oppertunites just now so that you understand the risk and potials of the technolgy using a web3 decentralised approch. You do not need to be a computer scientist or engineer, but you do need to understand the key ideas and technolgies so that you interact and beifit from them now.

An example of this is that many people use meta mask which is a good usfull producti to manage your private keys and interactions with a given blockchain, but the target audiance has to understand the setup and confirguration of this before they even get into the opertunities that this tool gives them access to. Application developers have also leveaged wallet techology like meta mask, and provide interfaces that allow you interact withe their ecosystem functionality using a third party wallet. I think this has benifts and drawbacks. The benifits being that developers can create interfaces to their web3 functionality without having to worry about the key management side of the development equation. This as I see it is barrier to adoption by non technical users as users will have to invest the time and effort to understand and then leverage these technologies to use the web3 resouerces. There is not much in the way of support for the users to be helped along the way and believe this is slowing adoption.

The wallet platform aims to address these short commings by by levelaging simple basic techniques to generate, secure, manage your keys, and make secure private payments. Adding to this a secure private peer to peer network with a cloud based services architecure, smart contract abi interface for importing already deployed smart contracts on any evm compable blockchain, and a modular package system that can be used to script and bring together the feature to create user interfaces in a simple and intuative way.   


 there has been little development focusing on the enabling the casual user to access and gain the benits of these techologies. Wether that is payments, communication, and or access to shared compute resources. Not to mention al many of the other use cases that are currently avaiable in the web2 world, such as ecommerce, ticketing, events, delivery, sharing and earning though inveastments with you saved or spare assets. These assest could be cryto currency that could be depoyed into a system that would earn a passive income, or from a spare computer and network resources that you may have available that could rean you rewards for the leasing of the usage of these resources.
