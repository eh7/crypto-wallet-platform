The summary structure

Lowering barriers to web3 applications and their benfit for users and contributers. Make the point that web tech enhances privacy, usabiltiy (web adpoted), see notes in little red note book for positives.

Explain the core functions need to deliver the basic core wallet platform, and outline the development requirements and functions that will be available to the users, and what they will be able to achieve in the initial version. 

Expalin the enhaced development requirements and functions need to deliver the final fully functional wallet platform, including all incentive structures to allow the delivery of the platform in a decentralised manner. Discuse how this is a long term goal and how there are more than one way to this and it all depends on the way the wallet platform will be licensed and marketed.

Explain the finalsied platform and the potential benifits and use cases to sell the big idea. Also define the varoiuse users/contibuters and how/why they are part of the over development plan.

Explain the the development path and how the intial platform would target a given user base (international remitance payments) as this is a growinig base, and then move on to the the other main features that will build long term comitment to the platform and how this will be achieved.

Define the proposed initial development phase 6 to 12 months, targeting a core platform that is targeted to international remitance payments.

Define the next development phase to show how this would be appoached, outside the 6 to 12 months inital development plan, explaining how this could be done in tadem if the resources to do this are in place.

Gant chart for the development tasks given a just one developer and an interface designer to create interface styling and onde developer to create core features and functionality. 
Explain and outline how the dev cycle could be speeded up showing gant table flow and how parts of the core functionality could be developed simitaiously if the development resources where in place.

Discuse ways that would allow the development speeded up and the resurces that may be required to do this.

Overview of technolgies to be used to build the solution and justify how/why they will be used.

Conclusions and further thoughts.



Modual Cytpo Wallet Platform

The Crytop Wallt Platform is an eco-system that is made up of several functional parts and protocols that will allow users to manange and interact with their crypto assests, through a web interface or a dedicated smart phone application in a user friendly way. Both the web interface and the app will use a shared code base and api to the wallet platform functionality.
Users of the platform will be able to access multipul preconfigured blockchains in a user friendly way. The package modual system withing the wallet platform will allow the users to install and manage pre built packages that will allow users to access community contributed content based services, these being crypto servcies for payments, investment, and per to peer communitations within the wallet platform.
All the services and package will be provided by developers and service providers, they will preconfigure these using standard methods, and this will allow them to offer their services and package applicatios through the wallet platform. For providing these services and applications the contributers will earn rewards. 

Justification for having service providers and application developers contributions;
https://www.zerohedge.com/crypto/whats-ailing-spotify - network commitment why??? a solution maybe
Need to build up usful functions (p2p coms, content access and distribution, smart contrcat interface, crypto chain data access, crypto investment access) to make sure users have attachemnt to the wallet as there are many options out there. 
Need to atract service providers, so as to allow wallet access to decentralised servcies and to incentivise the service providers with rewards to provide these services and to help creat a dedicated user base with an interest in the ecosystem growing and thriving. 
Need to atract developers, to create and them to get rewards for their work through the wallt platform. Agine helping to build a active user base that has an interst in the wallet p-latfom growing and creating revenue for their work.
