# The Modual Cytpo Wallet Platform

The Crytop Wallt Platform is an eco-system that is made up of several functional parts and protocols that will allow users to manange and interact with their crypto assests, through a web interface or a dedicated smart phone application in a user friendly way. Both the web interface and the app will use a shared code base and api to the wallet platform functionality.

Users of the platform will be able to access multipul preconfigured blockchains in a user friendly way. The package modual system withing the wallet platform will allow the users to install and manage pre built packages that will allow users to access community contributed content based services, these being crypto servcies for payments, investment, and per to peer communitations within the wallet platform.

All the services and package will be provided by developers and service providers, they will preconfigure these using standard methods, and this will allow them to offer their services and package applicatios through the wallet platform. For providing these services and applications the contributers will earn rewards. 

Justification for having service providers and application developers contributions;
