diagrams to show the wallet platform user types and wallet servericess each will interact with to enable the function that they provide to the overall platform.
***

End User:
 The person or people that will use the Wallet Platform to manage keys, send payments, invest, and interact with evm complient blockchain, smart contracts, and applications/protocols. In the final platform these users will have to confibute toward the service provision and developer contributed functionality, this creates an ecosystem that will.

Developers;
 These users will use the core wallet functionality to script and supply packaged services and functionality. These packaged units will allow users of the Wallet Platform to gain access to user contibuted functionality to pay, earn, and interact with blockchains functionality and services. These could range from invetment funds to functional ecommerce applications in the web3 space. In exsence developers will use the Wallet Platfrom to create function content that will enable data a payment privicy of the end use and the benifit for the developer to access web3 application development in a simple and more accessable way lowering the barrier to web3 application development.

Service providers;
 Service providers will gain rewards for the use of thier network resouce that they have contributed to the Wallet Platform. This will allow the Wallet Paltform to become a stand alone Hyperstructure in the future. This I think is the main benfit of web3 applications and functionality. Public infrastructure will be able to created and there will be little to no need for a centralised authrity to manage or provide the services. These services will in esecnce mange and grow under thier own contributions and users.


I think the reasn that the Ethereum Blockchain and Ecosystem has been a relative success are the benfit structures it gives it's differnet user bases. Originally miners and developers where attracted to the platform for the beifits it could bring them, but now these same developers and providers have an economic interest in the platform so as to now build applications and functiin around it to encorage adoption will increase the value of thier interest in the ecosystem. This approach is key to long term success of a decentralised platform like the one I am proposing, without getting this part correct it will be just another crypto wallet with it's limited user base with little potial for development from the platform users. Get these incentives and associated function right and the platform can grow beyond the original percentions and could potentialy become a part of public infrastructure as the adoption and this market increase.
