<h2>The Proposal</h2>
<a class="js-scroll-trigger top-link" href="#page-top">top</a>

<p>The Crytop Wallt Platform is an eco-system that is made up of several functional parts and protocols that will allow users to manange and interact with their crypto assests, through a web interface or a dedicated smart phone application in a user friendly way. Both the web interface and the app will use a shared code base and api to the wallet platform functionality.</p>
<p>Users of the platform will be able to access multipul preconfigured blockchains in a user friendly way. The package modual system withing the wallet platform will allow the users to install and manage pre built packages that will allow users to access community contributed content based services, these being crypto servcies for payments, investment, and per to peer communitations within the wallet platform.</p>
<p>All the services and package will be provided by developers and service providers, they will preconfigure these using standard methods, and this will allow them to offer their services and package applicatios through the wallet platform. For providing these services and applications the contributers will earn rewards. </p>
<p>Justification for having service providers and application developers contributions;</p>
<p>
https://www.zerohedge.com/crypto/whats-ailing-spotify - network commitment why??? a solution maybe
</p>
Need to build up useful functions (p2p coms, content access and distribution, smart contrcat interface, crypto chain data access, crypto investment access) to make sure users have attachemnt to the wallet as there are many options out there.</p>

<p>
Need to attract service providers, so as to allow wallet access to decentralised servcies and to incentivise the service providers with rewards to provide these services and to help creat a dedicated user base with an interest in the ecosystem growing and thriving. 
</p>
<p>
Need to attract developers, to create and them to get rewards for their work through the wallet platform. Again helping to build a active user base that has an interest in the wallet platfom growing and creating revenue for their work and services. </p>

<h2>Lowering Barriers to Web3 Applications</h2>
<a class="js-scroll-trigger top-link" href="#page-top">top</a>
	</p>

<p>Lowering barriers to adoption of web3 applications and their associated benfits for users and contributers is key to this proposed work. Web3 technologies have many benits over the traditional web2 applications, these include enhancing privacy, usabiltiy, and the movement away from centralised propriotory software provision that benifits the third party company or owner of the software and towards a world or security, privacy, system transparancy, and imutability. Where a central organistion can not change or censor some functionality that may finicaly benifit them now or in the future, but possibly not the usablity and open access to the servcies. In the web2 world the biggest example of this is where online ads have become the default means of a company to monetise thier software, where as in the web3 world the users pays for the servcies used direct to the company providing, the rewards provided are pre defined and clear before any servcie is used or provided. These rewards are set as part of the protocol that the provider and user use to provide the service.  </p>
<p>Currently web3 applications and wallets are focused on the more technical user just now, you need a level of technical knowlege to leverage these oppertunites currently so that you understand the risk and potenial benefit of the technolgy used. You do not need to be a computer scientist or engineer, but you do need to understand the key ideas and technolgies so that you interact and beifit from them now.</p>
<p>An example of this is that many people use meta mask which is a good usfull product to manage your private keys and interactions with a given blockchain, but the target audiance has to understand the setup and confirguration of this before they even get into the oportunities that this tool gives them access to. Application developers have also leveaged wallet techology like meta mask, and provide interfaces that allow you interact withe their ecosystem functionality using a third party wallet. I think this has benifts and drawbacks. The benifits being that developers can create interfaces to their web3 functionality without having to worry about the key management side of the development equation. This as I see it is barrier to adoption by non technical users as users will have to invest the time and effort to understand and then leverage these technologies to use the web3 resouerces. There is not much in the way of support for the users to be helped along the way and believe this is slowing adoption.</p>
<p>The wallet platform aims to address these short commings by levelaging simple basic techniques to generate, secure, manage your keys, and make secure private payments. Adding to this a secure private peer to peer network with a cloud based services architecure, smart contract abi interface for importing already deployed smart contracts on any evm compable blockchain, and a modular package system that can be used to script and bring together the feature and servcies to create user interfaces in a simple and intuative way. This usage can then create conributions back into platfrom to fund the development and provision of the platform servcies and application in a structure and transparent way.   </p>
<p>There has been some development focusing on enabling the casual user to access and gain the benits of web3 techologies. However this should improved over the comming years as the technologies and tooling improves. Currenlty within the web application wether web based of smart phone app based you are able to do most things is a userfriendly easy manner. Wether that is payments, communication, and or access to shared compute resources. Not to mention many other use cases that are currently avaiable in the web2 world, such as ecommerce, ticketing, events, delivery, sharing and earning though investments with you saved or spare assets. These assest could be cryto currency that could be depoyed into a system that would earn a passive income, or from a spare computer and network resources that you may have available that could rean you rewards for the leasing of the usage of these resources.</p>
<p>The wallet platform aim will be to enable all users to access a rich eco-system web3 servcies and functionality, through a platform that helps mitigate key managemnet risks, provides tools to make mitigating risks and errors easier, and that can make the users experience within the web3 application space more simple in general.</p>

<h2>3 Phase Development Plan</h2>
<a class="js-scroll-trigger top-link" href="#page-top">top</a>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>The Modular Crypto Wallet Platform will consist of an ecosystem of interfaces, services, nodes, and protocols. These together will allow the delivery of a decentralised modular crypto currency wallet platform.</p>
<p>The initial target use case will be the international remitance payment market. This has been chosen as it is a proven and growing market that the wallet platform will be aimed at and marketed to from the start of the development process. The idea being that this will attract users of this target market. The first phase of development will focus on the implementation and development of the secure private transfers on the etherum and polygon main networks. This work will form the foundation on to which all the other servcies offered through the wallet platform will sit upon. This first phase of development will aim to be deliverd within a 3 months timescale and will make up the initial release.</p>
<p>The second and third development phases will aim to expand the use cases and user base that the wallet platform will target.</p>
<p>Firstly in phase 2 to the general use crypto user base will be targeted by providing further key management services, communication and collabaration tools and function through the peer to peer networking and content sharing services. We will also imlement and introduce crypto assest management and investment services and functionality. All the services will be avaiable and usable through the wallet platform application package system. The package system will allow developers to contribute scripted and configarable application functionality, that other users on the walllet platform will be able to activate, use, and interacte with for a reward developer or not, this will depend on how the develper has configured the wallet platform packaged application to earn rewards. Some maybe free where the developer pays any fees for using the services, or it maybe a services that the developer actually gets a cut of the services fees and chargs that the use of the application may incure.  </p>
<p>For the final phase of development the focus will be on extending the use case to developers and service providers. In order to make the platform a trully decentralised platfrom and operating environment.
Wallet users will be able to access and interact with the applications created, and the developers will be rewarded economicly or by some other means depending on what the developers motivations where in creating the applications and publishing them to the wallet platform application store.
The service providers will be able to earn rewards for providing remote compute and data services to the wallet platform, so as to enable the decentrailsed delivery of the wallet platform services and the applications that are published on the platform. The peer to peer network infrastucture unlying commentions within the the wallet platform will also be developed during this final phase of development. 
In the final phase of development there will also be a need to define the core development foundation and how this organisation is mananged, and funded by the network activity and development improvment process.   </p>
<h3>Timescales</h3>
<p>Timescales for the phase 1 are 3 months, phase 2 are 6 months and phase 3 are 6 months. However if after phase 1 development has been realeased and there is the motivation and funding to speed up the delivery times, the development team could be scaled up so as to speed up the delivery of phase 2 or 3 functions and services and to meet any demand that may have been created.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>The main features of the wallet platform will be, private key managment, storage and recovery, secure private payments, a package based application repository, smart contract ABI interface, peer to peer network for communication within the wallet platform, and a decentralised web service functionality to allow the delivery and sharing of data in a trully decentralised manner. These features will combine to create a platform that will be easy to use for non technical users, private, secure, and have the ability to rewards developers and service providers with a rewards stream for the use of their services or work.</p>
<p>The wallet platform will allow crypto currency holders to make secure private transfers, manage their private keys, and access the wallet applications that will be contibuted to it's app store by it's developer user base. These contributed applications will provide functionality that will allow the wallet users to interact with already published smart contracts on a variarty of evm based blockchains, access crypto staking, mining, and investment applications, use the built in peer to peer network for communcation, interaction, payments and commerce with others users or organisations that are using or have publish applications on the wallet platfrom.  </p>
<p>The wallet platfrom will be targeted at everyday users providing a simple and usable experience within the web3 space. Where users need little to no understanding of the underlying function or the technology. The idea being that access to [ackage functionality will be simple and accessable, provide access to secure private payments, and will help drive the adoption of crypto currecy use in a private and commercial way, as it will provide these servcies in a simular maner to web3 commerce and content based system and platforms. </p>
<h3>Peer to Peer Reward Structure and Wallet Foundation Features</h3>
<p>The other main feature of the wallet platfrom is the decentrailsed nature of the system, and how it will allow conributer users to earn rewards for their contribution to running and providing functionality on the platform. These rewards should have the affect of building a community that has a economic interest in the use and expansion of the platform, it's servcies, applications and function.</p>
<p>Much like the http protocol, databases, and scripting languages enabled the delivery on commercial and content services accross the web2 world over 20 years ago. I evisage a platform where commercial entaprises could create functionality to sell, communicate, and interact with teir client base in a simple and use friendly way. I believ this approch will allow the stream adoption of crypto currencies as a means of commerce, and communication. </p>
<h3>Development Phases functionality and justification</h3>
<p>The phased development approach will allow the development of the wallet platform functionality to optomise the development resources, and marketing potential as the development phases progress.</p>
<p>The phase 1 cycle will target secure private payments for the internation remitance sector of users. This was chosen as it is a growing and proven use case for international money transfers.</p>
<p>The phase 2 cycle will then target develoment of the core wallet platform servcies and how they interact to create the full core services and function of the platform.</p>
<p>Phase 3 will focus on the development of the decentralised elements and associated token, reward stucutures, protocols and interfaces to deliver these functions. </p>
<p>Delevelopment Plan</p>
<p>To deliver the platform we think a 3 phase approach is most appropriate. This allows the key function or the platform to be implemented in a way that focus first om the foundation of the platform, secure private payments. Then the wallet platfrom core servcies and their interactions and interfaces, and finally the decentralised reward elements and protocols to build commitent and a dedicated technical user base that will have a long term benifit in contributing the success of the platform moving forward.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>solidity to create any smart contrcat functionality required to create the incentive and rewards structures and protocols, and network token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there will also be a requirement for other small nodejs modules to create the platform and these will be further defined by the overall developmebt team and/or the individual developer work on that functionality at the time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Development enviroment and approach</h3>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<a class="js-scroll-trigger top-link" href="#page-top">top</a>

<p>The implemenation of The Modual Crypto Wallet Platform will not be a small unertaking. It will need to fully analysed and planned before the development of any services or decentralised features are implemented and integrated within the platform. </p>
<p>I believe the 3 phase development approach I have proposed is flexable and will allow the development process to adapt and scale as we progress through the development phases and allow any learning from this process to feadback into future descisions, focus, and implement features within the develpoment tasks and technolgies used.</p>
<p>The first development phase will target a prooven market that is growing fast. I think by targeting this market at this stage it allows us to create a strong foundation for the platform, while also giving a good focus for the initial development work and marketing to focus on. This I believe has the potential to create a initial user base on to which we can grow the more advanced user base, as the more advanced features and services become avaiable during future development phases.</p>
<p>The second phase will then focus on creating the core services and defining how these services interact and function together. There is a level of complexity here, but this is minimised by spliting the decentrailsed features from this development phase so that we can focus the development of the wallet platfrom services and how the service interact make sure that usabilty is optomised and is the focus during this phase. </p>
<p>The third and final stage will then enhance the platform to create a trully decentrailsed eco-system that rewords contributors to it. It will also define and create the Wallet Platform Foundation that will control and manage future development after the third phase of the development is completed.</p>
<p>I see this final develoment phase as the key stage of the platform development in creating a long term diverse user base. Thus making the wallet platfrom a more long term offereing with the potential for creating a dedicated user base with a commitment to the platform, it's further development, and eco-system managementi and adoption, as these users (service providers and developers) will have an vested interest in it's future and in it's further develpment and adoption.  </p>
