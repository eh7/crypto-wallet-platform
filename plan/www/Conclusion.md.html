<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The implemenation of The Modual Crypto Wallet Platform will not be a small unertaking. It will need to fully analysed and planned before the development of any services or decentralised features are implemented and integrated within the platform. </p>
<p>I believe the 3 phase development approach I have proposed is flexable and will allow the development process to adapt and scale as we progress through the development phases and allow any learning from this process to feadback into future descisions, focus, and implement features within the develpoment tasks and technolgies used.</p>
<p>The first development phase will target a prooven market that is growing fast. I think by targeting this market at this stage it allows us to create a strong foundation for the platform, while also giving a good focus for the initial development work and marketing to focus on. This I believe has the potential to create a initial user base on to which we can grow the more advanced user base, as the more advanced features and services become avaiable during future development phases.</p>
<p>The second phase will then focus on creating the core services and defining how these services interact and function together. There is a level of complexity here, but this is minimised by spliting the decentrailsed features from this development phase so that we can focus the development of the wallet platfrom services and how the service interact make sure that usabilty is optomised and is the focus during this phase. </p>
<p>The third and final stage will then enhance the platform to create a trully decentrailsed eco-system that rewords contributors to it. It will also define and create the Wallet Platform Foundation that will control and manage future development after the third phase of the development is completed.</p>
<p>I see this final develoment phase as the key stage of the platform development in creating a long term diverse user base. Thus making the wallet platfrom a more long term offereing with the potential for creating a dedicated user base with a commitment to the platform, it's further development, and eco-system managementi and adoption, as these users (service providers and developers) will have an vested interest in it's future and in it's further develpment and adoption.  </p>
