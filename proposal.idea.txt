Modular Crypto Wallet Patform

The modular crypto wallet platform will allow managment of crypto assets, secure private payments, peer to peer communicartion network, and the delivery of web services content within the wallet patform. Functionlity could be extended with the modular system, opertaing on top of the wallet platform core functionality. 

A big part of the basic functionality is the wallet package managment system. This would allow developers to create and integrate services from the other core wallet system functionality, these will include key managment, P2P wallet network, Crypto assest investments, Smart Contract abi Interface, and Web Services. The modules would allow the creation user friendly interfaces for access to publicly avaiable smart contracts on any evm compatiable blockchaini, or other key functions within the wallet platform.

By using this approach the wallet functionality could be extended in the future either by developers or by the community of developers that will be built up around the wallet platform.

The basic wallet functionality is outlined below, the final specification will be further definded during the specification stage that we will be undertake as a first phase of the development cycle. This will allow us to focus on the the feature that we all feal is best suited to create a wallet platform that will be the most usful and attractive to protential users and developers moving forward. 

Basic Wallet functionality;

  Key managment, security and settings
   * create
   * import
   * manage
   * security (recover, backup, share, security tools) 

  Wallet application package managment
   * create a new package (admin function)
   * manage a package (admin function)
   * install
   * remove
   * manage

  Crypto asset management
   * transfer
   * manage
   * bridge to
   * bridge from
   * logs

  P2P wallet network
   * payment
   * names
   * web service
   * comms (message, share, video)
   * config

  Crypto assest investment
    * stake
    * mine
    * funds 
    * manage

  Smart Contract abi Interface
   * import smart contracts
   * manage smart contracts
   * smart contracts usage logs

  Web Service
   * consum service
   * publish service
   * serverless application deployment
   * serverless api
   * serverless application scripting lib



Current Development Status;
 * electron app - single code base for web based interface and mobile device app interface
 * abi smart contract interface basic impementation
 * libp2p wallet network basic implementaiona proof of setup, create, and comms
 * Options; cdk (poylgon), evm, level2 optionsplease think about it??
 * private assest payment network (see tornado cash) level 2 solution (deployment options???)
 * asset bridge (more thoughts???)
